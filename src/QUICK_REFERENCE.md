## 🚨 Common Questions

**Q: Why does it say "Supabase environment variables not configured"?**
A: That's normal! It's a friendly warning. The app works in demo mode until you add your credentials to `.env.local`.

**Q: Do I need to configure everything right now?**
A: No! The app works great for testing. Configure when you're ready to collect real signups.

**Q: Can I deploy to Vercel now?**
A: Yes! But configure Supabase first, or your production site will also be in demo mode.

**Q: Where do I put my API keys?**
A: In `.env.local` (already created for you in the project root)

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**
A: Sign up on your landing page. If you see a success message with a referral code, it's working!
